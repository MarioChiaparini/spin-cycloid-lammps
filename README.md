# spin-cycloid-lammps
<br>
That repository is for the studying on cycloid spin behaviour of BiFeO4, this is a numerical simulation of spin-lattice dynamics. The folder BiFeO4 have a topological spin structure and which the simulation will be analyze in python to find the magnons quaiparticles, where these components could be applied on magnonics devices.
